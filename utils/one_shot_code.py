Extension of countHands: How many possible opening states are there?
The number of 18 card hands is the space of possible opening observations
But, the state space includes the cards the opponent has as well
So, how many possible ways are there to distribute 18 cards to each of two players
    given that the suit doesn't matter?

7 -> 10
